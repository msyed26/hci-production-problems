## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): (Bars) https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/interface-essentials/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The guideline under interface essentials "Bars" says that users should know exactly where they are in the app and should be easy be able to navigate back to other pages.

-- The current schema of the site puts a giant "Create new account tag on the top".

--To apply the Bars rule, we can ditch the menu side bar, and create a border on the top in which a title could say "Account creation" and to the left of that can be a hamburger menu bar to replace the menu side bar that takes up a ton of margin.

---------------------------------

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): (Views) https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/interface-essentials/


* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The guideline under interface essentials "Views" has many different types of requirements, among them a major one I think that this mobile site lacks is arrangement. I think throwing everything into a single page may make a user feel like its too much too fill out, additionally if there is a field that they do not fill properly, the page will refresh and reset. My implementation would require segmenting the forum into 2 diffrent pages.


----------------------------------

* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The guideline under IOS Design theme (Clarity) states that throughout the app there should be consise speech and clarity. On the main page for creating an account there is a whole paragraph on the same page. We can ditch this to just add one simple line. "Already have an acccount? Login Here!" and create a hyperlink from that text.

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.

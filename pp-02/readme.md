## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13O0u0kzQqsnqy-uHx7E7l-Lfge
Your Rationale: The reason why I chose blue with a hue of 243 degrees is because, blue is amongst one of the
softest colors on the eyes. Blue also invokes a sense of relaxation and comofrt which is what most gamers
would desire when playing games.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52G0u0kvNjPnRrKsBnPF4fmPh9V
Your Rationale: I decided to chose a mix of lime green, olive green and a green with a hint of yellow all @ 171 degrees hue.
The reason I chose this was because how green describes and relates to spring and its attributes (Nice weather, green plants, etc).
This would encourage the user to be enthusiastic about the event making them feeling nice and happy about sprinfg after just going through winter.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=54K0x0krqllrmgNr4jrshndtupm
Your Rationale: I used a mix of purple, blue, and light-pink/red all @303 degrees hue. My reasoning behind this is because 
since kids would be using this site, it should be kept in mind to invoke happiy/energetic tones from the UI/UX design.
These colors would give kids a happy attitude to potentially learn.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=b3X4q3u1kZBjCNo6HTj8D++os++oLkrqllcq3Bip6jTUTFXYZzkrqllcq3Bip6jTUTFXYZz
Your Rationale: This one was a tough choice, especially because most of the cybersecurity course ads I have seen have been in either all black or red.
Red and blue would make sense to me, however, upon experimenting. I think Just a solid blue, with diffrent shades @ 252 degrees hue would be the best fit.
The reason why I say this, is because it is such a soft color that it would allow for the advertisement to be read properly. As for the color and being similar to cybersecurity, the blue gives certain vibes of command line backgrounds and scripts. I think this is just personal opinion.
